# Python Coverage Package
Adds an overview of your current test coverage to Atom.

## Installing
Use the Atom package manager, which can be found in the Settings view or run `apm install coverage` from the command line.

pip install nose
pip install coverage

In your virtualenv

## Usage
We expect your python modules to be under 'src' and a python virtual environment
which we activate and then run nosetests --with-coverage.

So you might want to set the values for those accordingly in the settings.

## Special thanks
Much thanks to philipgiuliani since this whole thing was based on his code.
